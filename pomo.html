        <h1>POSTMODERNISM</h1>
        Under normal circumstances, I'd put a further explanation of the topic. However, as this is not the topic of the examination,
        I'd also be tempted to just pull out an excerpt from good old Wikipedia, but I'm afraid even that site doesn't have it quite figured out:<br><br>
        Postmodernism is an intellectual stance or mode of discourse[1][2] characterized by skepticism towards the use of reason and logic. It questions the "grand narratives" of modernism, rejects the certainty of knowledge and stable meaning, and acknowledges the influence of ideology in maintaining political power. The idea of objective claims is dismissed as na√Øve realism,[5] emphasizing the conditional nature of knowledge. Postmodernism embraces self-referentiality, epistemological relativism, moral relativism, pluralism, irony, irreverence, and eclecticism. It opposes the "universal validity" of binary oppositions, stable identity, hierarchy, and categorization.
<br><br>
    Postmodernism could mean a lot of things. It could be the state of mind that our civilization is in, driving away from ideology and further into complete emptiness, as the anti nature of it consumes us and makes us question what we're really fighting for.
    However, in the simpler, almost childish world of art, PoMo gets a bit of a huge inspiration on Modernism, but adding more things to the flair, like performance art, concept art, "readymades" and doubting everything and everyone, to the point where it has been accused of promoting obscurantism.

    I've already said a bunch of nothing, so here are some images that might or might not be connected to Postmodernism:
