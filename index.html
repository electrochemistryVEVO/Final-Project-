        <h1>MODERNISM VS POSTMODERNISM</h1>
        A lot of people seemingly get these two art currents mixed, so it's of my interest to clear up this misunderstanding.
        There are quite some differences between the two, not limited to:
        <ol>
            <li>The time they were conceived</li>
            <li>The intentions of the artist</li>
            <li>Their perception about how to reach their own definition of art</li>
            <li>The divergence of PoMo into various subcurrents</li>
        </ol>
        Given these characteristics, it's clear that Modernism and Postmodernism are clearly not the same thing.
        However, a lot of ignorant people would rather have both of them as "contemporary art".
        This isn't a farfetched conclusion, I just felt like it was kinda silly.
